# Andy's Portfolio

The goal of this project is to demonstrate not only my ability in Vue.js for frontend development, but also my backend work using Python's Django Framework

## Technology
The Vue.JS frontend will consume a REST API created using Django REST Framework and which features projects I have worked on/am working on and it will host the data for a simple blog application where student developers can discuss their own experiences and journies. 

## Packages Used
- vue-router-seo
- PopperJS
- Bootstrap
- BootstrapVue
- jQuery
- Google Fonts
- Vuex
- Axios
- animate.css

Full credit goes to the authors of these packages as without them, it would be excruciatingly painful and difficult to create this website :)
